# ALGORITHMS, PART I.
### Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

### Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
## 1. ASSIGNAMENT: PERCOLATION

In summary, we have to make a matrix "percolates" while we are filling (opening sites) randomly. All of this explained this [Specification Assignament](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php}). This took me around a half of a month with several tries, I needed some help for the high requirements for testing with another repo. Pls, just use this as reference if you are here, I recommend see what It's different with yourselfs work.
